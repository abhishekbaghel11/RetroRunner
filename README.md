# Retro Runner

This is a 2D game built using the Pygame library and features AI-controlled agents trained with the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm. Itâ€™s a simple platformer game. This project showcases the combination of gaming and AI, allowing agents to learn and adapt to the game's challenges and play by itself.
