# Retro Runner

This is a 2D game built using the Pygame library and features AI-controlled agents trained with the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm. Itâ€™s a simple platformer game. This project showcases the combination of gaming and AI, allowing agents to learn and adapt to the game's challenges and play by itself.

# Installation guide:

- For installation of pygame in windows/Mac OS, in the terminal 
windows run:
```
pip install pygame 
```
-or-
```
pip3 install pygame
```

- For installation  of neat library : 
```
pip install neat-python
```
-or-
```
pip3 install neat-python
```

- Also, extract the graphics.zip file in that folder before running any file.
- WARNING!!! :- If upon extraction of the graphics.zip file, another graphics folder is created within the already existing graphics folder, move the content of the inner graphics folder to the outer graphics folder

# Running the file

- Open the code folder and then run the main.py file , in order to play the game
- If you want to see the AI playing the game, open the neat-code folder and then run the main.py(but for now, it is just training --> since, we didn't get enough time to fully train it)
- While training, don't use manual keys or it will alter the training process

# Dependencies:

- Pygame
- Neat-python
- Os
- Pickle

# Controls for the game 

- Left/A :- move left 
- Right/D :- move right
- Up/W :- move up(when next to a ladder)
- Down/S :- move right(when next to a ladder)
- Space :- jump
